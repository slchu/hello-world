# hello-world
My first repository!

I'm Shannon and I am currently learning how to use Github and make repositories! 
I am a rising third year studying Computer Science at the University of Virginia, and I'm super excited to learn more about everything computer science! 

I also love to play the violin, lift weights, and spend time with family and friends.
